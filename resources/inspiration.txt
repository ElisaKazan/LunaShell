Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.
Tomorrow may be too late.
Take a chance.
Follow your heart.
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Coffee? Coffee.
Don't regret anything you do, because in the end it makes you who you are.
There are seven days in the week and someday isn't one of them.
Go for a walk to clear your head.
The surest way to find your dream job is to create it.
*highfive*
Be happy! It drives people crazy.
Experiment. Fail. Learn. Repeat.
